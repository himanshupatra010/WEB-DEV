           <del>In publishing</del> and graphic design, Lorem ipsum
        </p>
        <b>is a placeholder</b> text commonly used to demonstrate
        the visual form of a document or a typeface
        without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum
        may be used as a placeholder before the final copy
        is <i>available.</i> It is also used to <mark>temporarily
        replace text in a process called greeking,</mark>
        which allows <u>designers to consider</u> the form of
        a <strong>webpage </strong>
